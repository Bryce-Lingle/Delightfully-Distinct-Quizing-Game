# Delightfully-Distinct-Quizing-Game

## Description:
For this assingnment, I created a quiz using my knowledge of JS. The interactive quiz takes the user input and keeps track of their score. This is then stored in local storage and a a highscore list is created. This project uses HMTL, CSS, and JS to function. This is a quiz that will continue to updated as we progress througout the UC Berekeley bootcamp.
